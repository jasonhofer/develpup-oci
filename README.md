Develpup OCI
============

This is still under development, so don't get your hopes up. It's loosely based on the Doctrine
Connection and Statement classes, but does not implement nor extend any Doctrine interfaces or
classes.

Use at your own risk.

See `tests/functional/PhpManualOciExamplesTest.php` for examples. Each test maps (mostly) to an
example in the PHP manual for the OCI8 extension.
